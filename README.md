 PART 1 (6/14/2025)    
Started working thursday night, finished part one on Saturday, plan to work more on Sunday

ArrayList<String> serviceNames - store the names of the services (example "jake and son plumbing")
ArrayList<String> serviceCategories - stores the category for each of the service (plumbing)
ArrayList<Double> hourlyRates - storess the hourly rate for each service (17.85)
boolean running - used to keep the menu to loop until the user picks and exit (set to false and it stops)
scanner input -  add user

in my menu system I used a while loop, it keeps the menu running till the user exits
it prints 
(1. add a service)
(2. exit         )
